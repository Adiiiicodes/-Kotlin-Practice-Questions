Kotlin-Krazy: My Journey Through the Land of Code! 🧑‍💻

Welcome to the wild world of Kotlin, where I’ve battled variables, wrestled with loops, and made peace with functions! In this folder, you'll find my collection of practice programs, each one a little adventure in the land of Kotlin.

Whether it's tackling OOP concepts or just trying to get my code to compile without crying (spoiler: there were tears), this repo is a testament to my Kotlin journey. Expect some code, a lot of comments (because future me needs reminders), and maybe even a few bugs that snuck in to keep things interesting!

P.S. No Kittens were harmed in the making of this code. 🐱
